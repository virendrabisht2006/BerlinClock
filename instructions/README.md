# Instructions

## Things to do to prepare in advance
 - ensure that your machine has a Java JDK installed on it (we are assuming Java 8 will be used)
 - install an IDE of your choice to perform the interview (we have used Jetbrains Intellij)
 - included with this archive is an example project that is built using gradle, before the interview you should familiarise yourself with working on a Gradle project in the IDE of your choice.
 - when your environment is set up correctly running `gradlew check` from the command line should complete successfully.

## We value
 - simple, elegant code that reads like a narrative
 - thinking about the code more than the writing of the code (we spend a lot of time thinking/debating about what we are writing)
 - transparency and feedback to support continuous learning
 - excellent testing that acts as documentation
 - challenging boundaries where necessary

## What to expect from our process
 - we will send you a similar archive to this one with a README.md file that will describe to you what we need from you for the interview
 - when you are happy with the solution (and believe it is fit for release to a production environment), please send the solution back to us.  We do not put a time limit on the exercise as we prioritise quality over timeliness.  We will leave it to you to determine what a reasonable amount of time would be.
 - we will then review your solution and feedback to you opportunities for improving the solution
 - we will independently review with your agent whether we will pursue your application further
